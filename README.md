## Description

This Web Application stores your time sensitive to do list to your local storage. This was accomplished using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Moment.js API. See [How To Use](#how-to-use) section for an explanation of how it works.

Overall a extremely challenging project, but I can away with a better understanding of Traversing the D.O.M., incorporating APIs into a website, local storage, and finally, adding elements, classes, data attributes with JS.

#### Technologies

- HTML

## How To Use

1. Type your To Do List into the middle section of each row.
2. If the text section is grey, those hours have already passed.
3. If the text section is red, this means it is the current hour.
4. If the text section is green, those hours are in the future.
5. Click on the save button to the right of the text area. This saves your to do list to you local storage.
6. To clear local storage do a 'hard reset' in google chrome or, erase the text and click on the save button.
